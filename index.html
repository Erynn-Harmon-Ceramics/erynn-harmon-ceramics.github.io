      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>
        I create ceramic pieces based on what inspires me. I love experimenting and challenging myself with different techniques. I focus on having fun and taking inspiration from the world around me as I make my work. This approach allows me to continue loving ceramics while staying curious and open to new ideas. I mainly use stoneware, underglazes, and glazes in my work, though I have tried other materials in the past and am excited to continue expanding my practice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a soon to be mom, I have adopted flexibility in my mindset and in my work, being sure to put my family first and use the admiration I have for them to inspire my work. Thinking this way reinforces my love for exploration and creativity, as nothing turns out exactly as planned, in life or in ceramic arts, and an open mindset allows me to find joy in discovery and unpredictability.
